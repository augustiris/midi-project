If you were doing this project all on your own what would your next step be?

I would read the manual for the board. I'm not sure how we're supposed to create sound
much less music.

I would look up how to turn on and an LED on the board. I would research where to put the
light and look in the repo and code provided to see if I could tie together what the board
does and what the repo code does.
